A simple way to communicate to a random person bypassing language barriers.

RandomYes is a django web application that enables direct communication with 
random people across languages.
Creating a new user is just clicking "new" button.
A new user gets an instant identity based on her GeoIP (proper random name is 
chosen), and Inbox, with interface in the local language.
The first page a new user gets is Compose, and it contains already few random
recipients, and a suggested message. User can press "send" button and wait 
for replies or new contacts.
Viewing a messages gets automatically translated (thnx to google translate)
to the user's language.
User can change preferences like country, language, name, etc in Preferences 
page. Changing a country gives a random name.

Messaging engine is heavily based on django-messages 0.4.1

It runs well with mysql+nginx+runfcgi on a 20$/Month VPS from

May it creates new bridges for humanity.
May you get a random yes :-)
